# GO-ECHO Starter

A simple starter for a Go, Echo, Templ, HTMX, Tailwind CSS project that includes theming, authentication.

I'm coming from Next JS where I used Next-Auth, Next-Theme, ShadCN, etc. and trying to make a similar setup with Go.

If you have any suggestions/improvements, please let me know!
